# Prusa Mini Firmware

You should not trust any firmware you download other than from 
a Prusa controlled environment.

The instructions to build it yourself are fairly easy, just see
https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy

But if you are unable to, for some reason. The DFU firmware here 
workes for me.
